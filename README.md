# Web Hook Configuration

This project involves creating a Ruby web app that can process web hooks from [Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com/login/?referrer=%2F).

It is important that the application can:

- Receive web hooks from Mandrill

- Processes the web hook data and store it in a suitable data store
- Display the following statistics:

    - Total number of emails sent
    - Total number of emails opened
    - Total number of clicks
    - Open rate per email type
    - Click rate per email type

Using the simplest route possible, this app will fulfil the necessary requirements through use of Rails, Go and a little html.
